An example homework repository who's purpose is to get more familiar with github desktop, the application version of git.
Personally, I agree with the instructor, using git through the console feels more intuitive/simple, the UI doesn't seem
entirely needed but oh well. This repo and assignment is being submitted late because I tried to do this assignment at the
last minute, but I had switched to linux on my computer, which was a nice change until I realized I was missing git and
github desktop. Entirely my own fault, so there goes 20 percent of my credit...
